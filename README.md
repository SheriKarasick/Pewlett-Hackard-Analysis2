## Summary
As Pewlett-Hackard prepares for substantial change in its workforce, it is wise to consider how these personnel changes will influence structure, form, and operations to guide the organization into the future.  With tens of thousands of employees department the organization in the near term; it is a good time to evaluate what 21st century workplaces and leadership skills will bolster the work of the organization and allow for this substantial change to be one that drives positive change instead of leadership loss.  

To cultivate a better understanding of how this retirement of large numbers of institutional employees will influence the work environment, multiple lines of inquiry are being investigated: 
* how can the deep institutional knowledge that is held by the exiting work population able to be retained and built upon in future business models
* how can this loss become an opportunity to address institutional intrinsic biases against URMs, particularly in leadership roles?
* How will different departments differentially be impacted by the exodus of so many employees in such a short period of time?

While the baby-boomer generation is defined by .... , new leadership models have brought in a great deal of dynamic change to how work environments are established and designed.  These work environments level the field for the participation of underrepresented minorities (URMs) including women and people of other ethnicities and bring diversity to the workforce that allows for progressive advances in business design and operations.  While the institutional wisdom of the old guard is to be treasured and valued, it is always imperative to keep an eye to how the organization is ensuring the ability to rapidly respond to the rapidly changing environment of the workforce today, in this era.
